- 👋 Hi, I’m Jarvy Lazan
- Currently studying CS and working part-time at Physiotec

- Most contributions you'll see here are anonymous. They are commits(I can't import pull requests or code reviews) from my work. I imported them using this handy  <a href="https://github.com/miromannino/Contributions-Importer-For-Github">tool</a> as we use Bitbucket for version control.


Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarvy-lazan-22445021b">Linkedin</a>!
